## Abstract
<p align="justify">River network extraction is crucial to keep track of the water resources. Various methods have
been implemented in times series to yield profound and incisive outputs and are still being
developed and combined with predefined available methods. We have carried out a structured
survey on these methods and have presented them with their outputs. There are numerous
websites available for data set collection. Some generalized methods are available like image
pro-cessing, using pre-defined models, or developing user-defined algorithms. For image
processing, various segmentation methods are available out of which clustering and threshold-
based segmentation are mostly used. Pre-defined models such as CNN, ResUNet, YOLO,
FasterCNN, MSCFF, etc. are available. These algorithms can be used for the extraction of
River networks but might not yield higher accuracies. Hence, this application purely
concentrates on extraction of river networks from satellite images.</p>

## Project Statement:
<p align="justify">To develop most efficient machine learning model for Automatic Extraction of River Networks from Satellite Images.</p>

## Project Domain / Area: Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Image Processing

## Project Introduction
<p align="justify">Water resource is the most significant source of life on Earth. Water resources
monitoring, protection and flood management is a predominant factor. Extraction of
Water Bodies from a satellite image is a crucial task. Previously the man-made space
probes were assigned to collect huge volume of data in the form of graphic pictorial
representations of certain surfaces, which resulted in load archives of images which
were ac-quired. However, now this gigantic amount of data is reshaped into valuable
executable data. Estimation and analysis of surface changes are crucial for a better
understanding and management of processes that cause them. Various machine learning
models such as Resnet, RCNN, YOLO, Faster-CNN, ResUnet, etc are further used for
extraction of river networks. Initially the basic steps include pre-processing of images
and converting them into uniform size for further training and feature extraction. Image
spectrum and image enhancements are added in order to extract RGB & grayscale
values which will be further trained to extract the exact river network from the provided
image based on training and validation testing. Thus, from above research some
attributes and models are taken into consideration for incisive outputs.</p>

## Aim: To develop a Machine Learning model to predict River networks using satellite Images
