## Abstract
<p align="justify">River network extraction is crucial to keep track of the water resources. Various methods have
been implemented in times series to yield profound and incisive outputs and are still being
developed and combined with predefined available methods. We have carried out a structured
survey on these methods and have presented them with their outputs. There are numerous
websites available for data set collection. Some generalized methods like image
processing, using pre-defined models, or developing user-defined algorithms are available. For image
processing, various segmentation methods are available out of which clustering and threshold-
based segmentation is mostly used. Pre-defined models such as CNN, ResUNet, YOLO,
FasterCNN, MSCFF, etc. are available. These algorithms can be used for the extraction of
River networks might not yield higher accuracies. Hence, this application focuses on river network extraction from satellite images.</p>

## Project Statement:
<p align="justify">To develop the most efficient machine learning model for Automatic Extraction of River Networks from Satellite Images.</p>

## Project Domain / Area: Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Image Processing

## Project Introduction
<p align="justify">Water resources are the most significant source of life on Earth. Water resources
monitoring, protection, and flood management are predominant factors. Extraction of
Water Bodies from a satellite image is a crucial task. Previously man-made space
probes were assigned to collect huge volumes of data in graphic pictorial
representations of certain surfaces, resulting in load archives of acquired images. However, this gigantic amount of data is now reshaped into valuable
executable data. Estimation and analysis of surface changes are crucial for a better
understanding and management of the processes that cause them. Various machine learning
models such as Resnet, RCNN, YOLO, Faster-CNN, ResUnet, etc are further used to extract river networks. Initially, the basic steps include pre-processing images
and converting them into uniform sizes for further training and feature extraction. Image
spectrum and image enhancements are added to extract RGB & grayscale
values which will be further trained to extract the exact river network from the provided
image based on training and validation testing. Thus, from the above research, some
attributes and models are considered for incisive outputs.</p>

## Aim: To develop a Machine Learning model to predict River networks using satellite Images
